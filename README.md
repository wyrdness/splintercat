## Overview

The Splintercat is a fearsome critter from American lumberjack folklore, described as a flying cat-like creature with an incredibly tough forehead. According to the tall tales, it hunts by flying headfirst at tremendous speed into trees, smashing them to splinters.

The impact knocks out raccoons, bee hives, and other food sources, which the dazed but unharmed Splintercat then consumes. The creature was said to be responsible for broken and splintered trees found in the forest.

Like all fearsome critters, it served as entertainment in lumber camps and as a humorous explanation for natural phenomena (damaged trees from storms, disease, or woodpeckers).
